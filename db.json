      "description": "Gigabyte's Gaming OC comes with a very calm design language, the main colors are black on the front and gray on the backplate. Under the hood we found a powerful 20+4 VRM design. Unlike some other custom designs today, Gigabyte is giving you the whole 600 W maximum power limit adjustment range, the default out of the box power limit is still the same 450 W as on the Founders Edition. Thermal performance of the cooler is good, definitely better than the Founders Edition."
