      "summary": "Gigabyte's Gaming OC comes with a very calm design language, the main colors are black on the front and gray on the backplate. Under the hood we found a powerful 20+4 VRM design. Unlike some other custom designs today, Gigabyte is giving you the whole 600 W maximum power limit adjustment range, the default out of the box power limit is still the same 450 W as on the Founders Edition. Thermal performance of the cooler is good, definitely better than the Founders Edition. Unfortunately it seems that Gigabyte favored lower temperatures over fan noise with their default BIOS fan settings. While temperatures are excellent with 60°C on the GPU and 67°C on the memory, fan noise is rather high at 37 dBA. The good thing is that they include a dual BIOS feature with a 'quiet' BIOS as second option. In this mode the card runs at only 32.6 dBA, which is considerably quieter than the NVIDIA FE, with only a small increase in temperatures. What I like here is that both BIOSes have meaningful differences, so making a choice is a real option"

      "summary": "ASRock's Taichi name is legendary, we've seen so many wonderful motherboards and graphics cards with that branding, so the RX 7900 XTX Taichi has big shoes to fill. The triple-fan, triple-slot thermal solution does a great job keeping the card cool. Gaming temperatures are below 60°C, which is an impressive achievement, especially considering the performance offered. Noise levels with the default BIOS are 'good,' only 32 dBA is considerably lower than the AMD reference card, but other custom designs are still quieter. ASRock's solution for that is the dual BIOS, which lets you activate a 'Quiet' mode BIOS. Now the noise levels are stunning—the card is whisper quiet, the quietest RX 7900 XTX that we've tested. Actually, with only 27.6 dBA it's among the quietest graphics cards that I've tested in a long time—and we're talking about a high-end GPU here that can achieve 4K60 easily. While nearly all other quiet BIOS designs that I know of lower the fan speed, while allowing higher temperatures at the same time, ASRock's approach is quite different. They've set their card to run at lower clock and voltage, which lowers the heat output considerably, because the card now operates closer to its maximum efficiency point. Lower heat output means the fans can run slower to achieve the same temperature. That's exactly what ASRock did: the regular and the quiet mode BIOS both have the GPU running at 59°C, but since the quiet BIOS has such reduced heat output, the fan speed can be lower."

      "summary": "The unique selling point of the ASUS RTX 3080 Noctua is its thermal solution based around the high-quality fans from the Austrian company. Even the first glance shows that this is a Noctua card—the signature tan and brown color scheme is hard to miss. In terms of noise levels, the ASUS card is a revelation at only 23.4 dBA; the card is so quiet it's almost at the limits of my noise-testing capability. I'm testing in a quiet neighborhood with all other computers shut off and no running fans or AC, and the card is still almost inaudible. Basically, you have to stand next to the system on an open bench and concentrate on the card to somewhat discern its noise. As soon as you start moving, your clothes will make enough noise to overpower what little sound the card puts out—absolutely incredible! Often, low noise means compromising on temperatures, which is not the case with the RTX 3080 Noctua to further sweeten the deal. We measured temperatures of only 67 °C under full load, which is better than most RTX 3080 cards—I've tested 10 models to date. No doubt ASUS found a great balance between noise levels and temperatures, which of course is much easier to achieve if you have so much cooling performance available. In my opinion, there's no reason to use the dual BIOS feature to activate the 'Performance' BIOS. At 30 dBA, its noise levels are still good, but you only reduce temperatures from 67°C to 58°C in return, which doesn't gain you anything other than a +15 MHz boost bin from NVIDIA's boost clock algorithm due to slightly lower temperature."
